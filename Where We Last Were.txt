We were successfully loading in an Adventure from the Mongo DB in adventurePage, but, since statGain doesn't exist
in this particular Adventure, that's not being loaded in, and when you try to do various things with statGain
(as the page is programmed to do) you get an error. Trying to bracket them off doesn't really work either.
Figure out how to fix this.

(Next)

-Add the possibility for routes that allow you to be more fine-grained -> currently you can get Adventures and get a single Adventure,
but you should add the ability to get a single variable of an Adventure (ie, GET /api/adventures/earthRoom1/next)

-Also, in order to properly make your Adventure Schema work, you will need a Schema for each complex object (Tests, Next, and StatGain)

//if (statGain) and other things of this type will check whether StatGain exists or not, which should help to reduce the problem of adventurePage
crashing because of it trying to do stuff with undefined variables.

CUURENT: I discovered a strange bug - even though you changed inventory.js, the ReactDOM is not in fact registering those changes, and is loading the
old, non-functional file. This is odd. Perhaps you could try restarting the laptop. I wonder if that'd do anything. Hmm...
